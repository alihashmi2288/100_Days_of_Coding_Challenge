// Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 41. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.
var megician = ["David Copperfield", "Harry Houdini", "Criss Angel", "Dynamo"];
function make_great(megicianArray) {
    for (var i = 0; i < megicianArray.length; i++) {
        megician[i] = 'The Great ' + megicianArray[i];
    }
}
function show_magicians(megicians) {
    megicians.forEach(function (megiciansName) {
        console.log(megiciansName);
    });
}
make_great(megician);
show_magicians(megician);
