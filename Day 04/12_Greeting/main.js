//Question 12: Greetings: Use the array from Exercise 11. Instead of just printing each personâ€™s name, print a message to them. The message should be the same for each person, but personalized with their name.
//Persons name in array
var names = ["Ali", "Umer", "Imran", "Kashif", "Kamran"];
//print message with each person
for (var _i = 0, names_1 = names; _i < names_1.length; _i++) {
    var name_1 = names_1[_i];
    console.log("Hello ".concat(name_1, ", would you like to learn some Python today?"));
}
